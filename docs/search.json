    "text": "Part 1: Healthcare Access for Vulnerable Populations\n\nResearch Question\nWhich Pennsylvania counties have the highest proportion of vulnerable populations (elderly + low-income) living far from hospitals?\nYour analysis should identify counties that should be priorities for healthcare investment and policy intervention.\n\n\nRequired Analysis Steps\nComplete the following analysis, documenting each step with code and brief explanations:\n\nStep 1: Data Collection (5 points)\nLoad the required spatial data: - Pennsylvania county boundaries - Pennsylvania hospitals (from lecture data) - Pennsylvania census tracts\nYour Task:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tidycensus)\nlibrary(tigris)\n\n\n# Load spatial data\n\n\n\n\n# Check that all data loaded correctly\n\nQuestions to answer: - How many hospitals are in your dataset? - How many census tracts? - What coordinate reference system is each dataset in?\n\n\n\nStep 2: Get Demographic Data\nUse tidycensus to download tract-level demographic data for Pennsylvania.\nRequired variables: - Total population - Median household income - Population 65 years and over (you may need to sum multiple age categories)\nYour Task:\n\n# Get demographic data from ACS\n\n\n\n\n# Join to tract boundaries\n\nQuestions to answer: - What year of ACS data are you using? - How many tracts have missing income data? - What is the median income across all PA census tracts?\n\n\n\nStep 3: Define Vulnerable Populations\nIdentify census tracts with vulnerable populations based on TWO criteria: 1. Low median household income (choose an appropriate threshold) 2. Significant elderly population (choose an appropriate threshold)\nYour Task:\n\n# Filter for vulnerable tracts based on your criteria\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat income threshold did you choose and why?\nWhat elderly population threshold did you choose and why?\nHow many tracts meet your vulnerability criteria?\nWhat percentage of PA census tracts are considered vulnerable by your definition?\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Calculate Distance to Hospitals\nFor each vulnerable tract, calculate the distance to the nearest hospital.\nYour Task:\n\n# Transform to appropriate projected CRS\n\n\n# Calculate distance from each tract centroid to nearest hospital\n\nRequirements:\n\nUse an appropriate projected coordinate system for Pennsylvania\nCalculate distances in miles\nExplain why you chose your projection\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhat is the average distance to the nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts?\nWhat is the maximum distance?\nHow many vulnerable tracts are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital?\n\n\n\n\nStep 5: Identify Underserved Areas\nDefine “underserved” as vulnerable tracts that are more than 15 miles from the nearest hospital.\nYour Task:\n\n# Create underserved variable\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nHow many tracts are underserved?\nWhat percentage of vulnerable tracts are underserved?\nDoes this surprise you? Why or why not?\n\n\n\n\nStep 6: Aggregate to County Level\nUse spatial joins and aggregation to calculate county-level statistics about vulnerable populations and hospital access.\nYour Task:\n\n# Spatial join tracts to counties\n\n\n# Aggregate statistics by county\n\nRequired county-level statistics:\n\nNumber of vulnerable tracts\nNumber of underserved tracts\n\nPercentage of vulnerable tracts that are underserved\nAverage distance to nearest hospital for vulnerable tracts\nTotal vulnerable population\n\nQuestions to answer:\n\nWhich 5 counties have the highest percentage of underserved vulnerable tracts?\nWhich counties have the most vulnerable people living far from hospitals?\nAre there any patterns in where underserved counties are located?\n\n\n\n\nStep 7: Create Summary Table\nCreate a professional table showing the top 10 priority counties for healthcare investment.\nYour Task:\n\n# Create and format priority counties table\n\nRequirements:\n\nUse knitr::kable() or similar for formatting\nInclude descriptive column names\nFormat numbers appropriately (commas for population, percentages, etc.)\nAdd an informative caption\nSort by priority (you decide the metric)"

    "text": "Part 3: Bring Your Own Data Analysis\nChoose your own additional spatial dataset and conduct a supplementary analysis.\n\nChallenge Options\nChoose ONE of the following challenge exercises, or propose your own research question using OpenDataPhilly data (https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/).\nNote these are just loose suggestions to spark ideas - follow or make your own as the data permits and as your ideas evolve. This analysis should include bringing in your own dataset, ensuring the projection/CRS of your layers align and are appropriate for the analysis (not lat/long or geodetic coordinate systems). The analysis portion should include some combination of spatial and attribute operations to answer a relatively straightforward question\n\n\nEducation & Youth Services\nOption A: Educational Desert Analysis\n\nData: Schools, Libraries, Recreation Centers, Census tracts (child population)\nQuestion: “Which neighborhoods lack adequate educational infrastructure for children?”\nOperations: Buffer schools/libraries (0.5 mile walking distance), identify coverage gaps, overlay with child population density\nPolicy relevance: School district planning, library placement, after-school program siting\n\nOption B: School Safety Zones\n\nData: Schools, Crime Incidents, Bike Network\nQuestion: “Are school zones safe for walking/biking, or are they crime hotspots?”\nOperations: Buffer schools (1000ft safety zone), spatial join with crime incidents, assess bike infrastructure coverage\nPolicy relevance: Safe Routes to School programs, crossing guard placement\n\n\n\nEnvironmental Justice\nOption C: Green Space Equity\n\nData: Parks, Street Trees, Census tracts (race/income demographics)\nQuestion: “Do low-income and minority neighborhoods have equitable access to green space?”\nOperations: Buffer parks (10-minute walk = 0.5 mile), calculate tree canopy or park acreage per capita, compare by demographics\nPolicy relevance: Climate resilience, environmental justice, urban forestry investment\n\n\n\nPublic Safety & Justice\nOption D: Crime & Community Resources\n\nData: Crime Incidents, Recreation Centers, Libraries, Street Lights\nQuestion: “Are high-crime areas underserved by community resources?”\nOperations: Aggregate crime counts to census tracts or neighborhoods, count community resources per area, spatial correlation analysis\nPolicy relevance: Community investment, violence prevention strategies\n\n\n\nInfrastructure & Services\nOption E: Polling Place Accessibility\n\nData: Polling Places, SEPTA stops, Census tracts (elderly population, disability rates)\nQuestion: “Are polling places accessible for elderly and disabled voters?”\nOperations: Buffer polling places and transit stops, identify vulnerable populations, find areas lacking access\nPolicy relevance: Voting rights, election infrastructure, ADA compliance\n\n\n\n\nHealth & Wellness\nOption F: Recreation & Population Health\n\nData: Recreation Centers, Playgrounds, Parks, Census tracts (demographics)\nQuestion: “Is lack of recreation access associated with vulnerable populations?”\nOperations: Calculate recreation facilities per capita by neighborhood, buffer facilities for walking access, overlay with demographic indicators\nPolicy relevance: Public health investment, recreation programming, obesity prevention\n\n\n\n\nEmergency Services\nOption G: EMS Response Coverage\n\nData: Fire Stations, EMS stations, Population density, High-rise buildings\nQuestion: “Are population-dense areas adequately covered by emergency services?”\nOperations: Create service area buffers (5-minute drive = ~2 miles), assess population coverage, identify gaps in high-density areas\nPolicy relevance: Emergency preparedness, station siting decisions\n\n\n\n\nArts & Culture\nOption H: Cultural Asset Distribution\n\nData: Public Art, Museums, Historic sites/markers, Neighborhoods\nQuestion: “Do all neighborhoods have equitable access to cultural amenities?”\nOperations: Count cultural assets per neighborhood, normalize by population, compare distribution across demographic groups\nPolicy relevance: Cultural equity, tourism, quality of life, neighborhood identity\n\n\n\n\n\nData Sources\nOpenDataPhilly: https://opendataphilly.org/datasets/\n\nMost datasets available as GeoJSON, Shapefile, or CSV with coordinates\nAlways check the Metadata for a data dictionary of the fields.\n\nAdditional Sources:\n\nPennsylvania Open Data: https://data.pa.gov/\nCensus Bureau (via tidycensus): Demographics, economic indicators, commute patterns\nTIGER/Line (via tigris): Geographic boundaries\n\n\n\nRecommended Starting Points\nIf you’re feeling confident: Choose an advanced challenge with multiple data layers. If you are a beginner, choose something more manageable that helps you understand the basics\nIf you have a different idea: Propose your own question! Just make sure: - You can access the spatial data - You can perform at least 2 spatial operations\n\n\nYour Analysis\nYour Task:\n\nFind and load additional data\n\nDocument your data source\nCheck and standardize the CRS\nProvide basic summary statistics\n\n\n\n# Load your additional dataset\n\nQuestions to answer: - What dataset did you choose and why? - What is the data source and date? - How many features does it contain? - What CRS is it in? Did you need to transform it?\n\n\nPose a research question\n\nWrite a clear research statement that your analysis will answer.\nExamples: - “Do vulnerable tracts have adequate public transit access to hospitals?” - “Are EMS stations appropriately located near vulnerable populations?” - “Do areas with low vehicle access have worse hospital access?”\n\n\nConduct spatial analysis\n\nUse at least TWO spatial operations to answer your research question.\nRequired operations (choose 2+): - Buffers - Spatial joins - Spatial filtering with predicates - Distance calculations - Intersections or unions - Point-in-polygon aggregation\nYour Task:\n\n# Your spatial analysis\n\nAnalysis requirements: - Clear code comments explaining each step - Appropriate CRS transformations - Summary statistics or counts - At least one map showing your findings - Brief interpretation of results (3-5 sentences)\nYour interpretation:\n[Write your findings here]"
